# Tech stack

## Frontend
React 19: embeded in .Net mvc + Vite: fast dev server, HMR, simple build

TypeScript 5: supports static code typing and better IDE support

Tailwind 4 (PostCSS): quick to ship functional UI; purge keeps bundle tiny.

## Backend
.NET 8: great perf, minimal APIs available, good testing story.

Server-authoritative: exactly what I want for deterministic rules.

PostgreSQL: solid, cheap, reliable; EF Core support is mature.

## CI/CD and hosting
GithubActions: for creating CI/CD pipelines
DigitalOcean: for hosting application docker images
