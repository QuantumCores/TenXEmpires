# App TenXEmpires (MVP)

## Main problem
 There are no web based 4x games like civilization or humankind that people can play at work, that takes only few klick a day.

## MVP 
Deliver a simple, playable single-player prototype that demonstrates:

 - player login/logout mechanism
 - A basic 20x15 hexagonal tile-based world map 
 - simple AI - takes moves based on simple priority list
 - Turn-based play - player turn -> NPC turn -> repeat
 - Basic units - warior, slinger
 - Unit movement on map 
 - Basic resources on map - wheat, wood, stone, iron
 - City management - city can produce resources that are in its reach
 - Game state is saved in backend and loaded on player demand (max 3 game save slots per player)
 
## What is not part of MVP

 - No tech tree
 - no diplomacy
 - no complex city management

## Success criteria
 - Game runs fully in browser
 - Player can move units, end turn, see AI respond
 - Turn loop fully functional
 - Player can can save and load game (max 3 game save slots)
 - 75% of players finish their game
 - 90% of players finish at least 5 turns

Analyze the provided information, focusing on aspects relevant to creating the PRD. Consider the following points:
<prd_analysis>

Identify the main problem the product is intended to solve.

Define the key functionalities of the MVP.

Consider potential user stories and user flows.

Think about success criteria and how they can be measured.

Assess project constraints and their impact on product development.
</prd_analysis>

Based on the analysis, generate a list of 10 combined questions and recommendations (question + recommendation). These should address any ambiguities, potential issues, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective PRD. Consider questions related to:

Details of the user's problem

Prioritization of functionalities

Expected user experience

Measurable success metrics

Potential risks and challenges

Timeline and resources

<pytania> List your questions and recommendations here, numbered for clarity:

Example:

Do you plan to introduce paid subscriptions from the start of the project?

Recommendation: The first stage of the project could focus on free features to attract users, with paid features introduced at a later stage.
</pytania>

Continue this process by generating new questions and recommendations based on the user's responses until the user explicitly asks for a summary.

Remember to focus on clarity, relevance, and accuracy of the output. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.

The analytical work should be conducted in a thinking block. The final output should consist solely of questions and recommendations and should not duplicate or repeat any work done in the prd_analysis section.
