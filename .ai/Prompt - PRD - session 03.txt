1. Given that the single developer has limited React experience, what is the preferred frontend framework setup and structure (pure React + Vite, or a minimal template)?
   Recommendation: Use a lightweight React + Vite + TailwindCSS setup with TypeScript to maximize productivity and maintain readability while leveraging AI code generation for boilerplate UI.

2. What backend stack and database technology will be used for save/load, authentication, and analytics storage?
   Recommendation: Use .NET 8 minimal APIs with PostgreSQL for game state and metrics; expose REST endpoints for login (OAuth), save/load, and analytics events.

3. How will combat resolution and city capture be handled—deterministic or RNG-based—and how are results communicated to the player?
   Recommendation: Define deterministic formulas (Attack vs. Defense → HP loss per round until one reaches 0) and simple UI feedback (e.g., text overlay: “Warrior defeated Slinger”).

4. Should AI and player take alternating full turns or simultaneous resolution, and how long should a full turn last (including AI processing)?
   Recommendation: Maintain a strict “player → AI → player” loop with capped AI compute <300ms and immediate visual update to preserve perceived responsiveness.

5. Will there be any in-game feedback or visual indication for city defenders, reach borders, and explored tiles?
   Recommendation: Implement simple visual cues—colored outlines (e.g., green for reach, blue for defenders, gray fog for unexplored)—using SVG overlays to improve clarity without animation.

6. What is the desired save file format and data granularity (per turn, per map tile, per unit)?
   Recommendation: Use JSON serialization of world state (tiles, units, cities, turn number, RNG seed, AI states) compressed before storage; ensure schema versioning for future compatibility.

7. How should error handling and recovery be designed (e.g., failed save, lost connection, corrupted data)?
   Recommendation: Add automatic retry for failed saves, fallback local save (browser IndexedDB), and user alerts (“Save failed, retry?”) to prevent progress loss.

8. Given the 6-week solo timeline, which non-essential features can be cut or simplified if delays occur (e.g., AI expansion, autosaves, full analytics)?
   Recommendation: Define a tiered priority:

   * P1: map, unit movement, turn loop, save/load
   * P2: AI defense/attack, OAuth login
   * P3: autosaves, analytics, city resource management.

9. How will testing and validation be managed, given the one-person team and limited frontend experience?
   Recommendation: Use automated unit tests for backend logic (AI, combat, save/load) and Cypress or Playwright for minimal E2E tests (start game, move, end turn, save/load); weekly milestone reviews using AI-based code audits.

10. What is the plan for deployment and hosting (local, cloud, or web platform)?
    Recommendation: Host backend and static frontend on a simple Azure App Service or Render.com deployment with CI/CD from GitHub; use environment variables for OAuth and database secrets.
