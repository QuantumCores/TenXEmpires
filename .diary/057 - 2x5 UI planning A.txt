1. Use CSS transforms for 75–150% zoom per PRD, but size canvases at `CSSpx * devicePixelRatio`; on large zoom changes, re-render the base (tiles) layer to avoid blur while keeping overlays/units real-time

2. Use math-based conversion (odd-r → axial/cube) to map pointer to `{row,col}`; precompute neighbor tables; avoid pixel readbacks; run lightweight A* for previews using `/unit-definitions`, clamped to unit movement/attack rules.

3. Left-click selects/acts; middle-mouse or Space+drag pans; two-finger trackpad pans the container; right-click/ESC cancels; show a subtle “Map Focused” indicator so Arrow/WASD only pan when the map has focus.

4. Keep one modal at a time; encode as `?modal=saves|settings|account-delete|help` with optional `&tab=manual|autosaves`; navigate to a separate `?modal=confirm` for overwrite to keep Back behavior predictable.

5. Yes—after resolving the active game, prefetch `/games/{id}/state`, `/unit-definitions`, and `/maps/{code}/tiles` in parallel; show a full-screen loading overlay; if none active, open `?modal=start-new` instead of navigating away from the map shell.

6. Use a centered blocking overlay (map blurred) with CTAs: Retry, Login (401/403), Start New (404/finished), Learn More (422 `SCHEMA_MISMATCH`); include error code and a copy-to-clipboard details link.

7. Yes—N: next unit without action, G: toggle grid, R: reset camera, ?: help modal; display shortcuts in a cheatsheet within `?modal=help` and reference them via `aria-describedby` on buttons.

8. Show a cookie/analytics banner on first visit; queue events in memory until accepted; after consent, send `/analytics/batch` once per turn with `clientRequestId`; if declined, log only essential technical events.

9. Add a small status pill (Online/Offline/Limited) and a non-blocking toast on `429`; back off polling to 2–3 s during limits; disable action buttons with a countdown and re-enable automatically after backoff.


10. Do stress about 300kb budget we can rise it to 500kb or 1MB if needed. Just keep in mind that smaller bundle is prefered but it's mandatory.
