## Creating the Migration File

Given the context of the user's message, create a database migration file inside the `db/migrations/` folder.

The file MUST follow this naming convention:

The file MUST be named using the format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`, using **UTC time** with appropriate casing for months, minutes, and seconds:

1. `YYYY` – Four digits for the year (e.g., `2024`)
2. `MM` – Two digits for the month (01 to 12)
3. `DD` – Two digits for the day of the month (01 to 31)
4. `HH` – Two digits for the hour in 24-hour format (00 to 23)
5. `mm` – Two digits for the minutes (00 to 59)
6. `ss` – Two digits for the seconds (00 to 59)
7. Add a relevant short description of the migration

**Example:**

```
20240906123045_create_profiles.sql
```

## SQL Guidelines

Write SQL code for PostgreSQL migration:

* Includes a **header comment** with metadata about the migration, such as purpose, affected tables/columns, and any special considerations
* Contains **detailed comments** explaining the purpose and expected behavior of each step in the migration
* Add **extensive comments** for any destructive SQL commands, including `truncate`, `drop`, or column modifications
* When defining RLS policies do whatever we agreed to.

The generated SQL code should be **production-ready**, **well-documented**, and aligned with **PostgreSQL best practices**.
