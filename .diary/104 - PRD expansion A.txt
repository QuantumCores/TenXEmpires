1. selecting specific individual adjacent hexes to add to the territory. Server side is ready. City has list of tiles under controll. PRD is not up to date.
2. Define "Wooden Walls" as adding +10 to the City's Defence.
3. Maintain the existing deterministic auto-behavior for the AI in the MVP. 
4. Restrict the city to one "production" action per turn (Spawn Unit OR Build Building OR Expand). 
5. Spawn the unit immediately for visual feedback. Become usable instantly during the current turn - this is current behavior
6. Retain the "nearest free adjacent tile" logic (checking North then clockwise). 
7. Store the expansion cost in the Database alongside unit and building definitions. But not for tiles. 
8. Cost of tile will grow with number of city controlled tiles.
9. Yes a resource cap is good idea. We can later introduce granary, storage buildings to increase cap. Makes game more interesting
10. Implement a priority system: If a friendly unit is on the city, the first click selects the unit. A second click on the same tile opens the City Modal.
