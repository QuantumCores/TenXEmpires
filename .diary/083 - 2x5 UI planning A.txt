1. I'm not sure. TBD.

2. Add `GET /auth/keepalive` (no body, returns 204) that refreshes the auth cookie; call only on user intent to conserve the 60 req/min budget.

3. Yes—emit strong ETag and return `304` when unchanged; the client polls with `If-None-Match` to save bandwidth and CPU

4. Use `hasActed=false` from server state to avoid mismatches (a unit that attacked should not be surfaced as next).

5. Include `turnSummary` whenever it changes (move/attack/end-turn) so UI toasts/panels stay consistent without extra fetches.

6. Prefer `403` with `{ code: 'CSRF_INVALID' }`; if `419` is retained, document it clearly and ensure interceptors treat it like `401/403`.

7. Yes—return `expiresAt` (e.g., `2025-12-31T23:59:59Z`) as the source of truth; the client shows “Expires in ~N days” based on this field.

8. Return `409 GAME_LIMIT_REACHED`; client opens the “Start New Game” confirm or offers “Delete current game” per the finalized UX.

9. Yes—rotate token on login and respond with a header (e.g., `X-Csrf-Rotated: 1`) so the SPA broadcasts the new value immediately across tabs.

10. Yes—echo the key on success and return the first response for duplicates; client retries at most once with the same UUID, never persisting keys.

You are an AI assistant whose task is to summarize the conversation about UI architecture planning for MVP and prepare a concise summary for the next stage of development. In the conversation history you will find the following information:
1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. Tech stack information
3. API plan
4. Conversation history containing questions and answers
5. UI architecture recommendations

Your task is to:
1. Summarize the conversation history, focusing on all decisions related to UI architecture planning.
2. Match the model's recommendations to the answers given in the conversation history. Identify which recommendations are relevant based on the discussion.
3. Prepare a detailed conversation summary that includes:
   a. Main UI architecture requirements
   b. Key views, screens, and user flows
   c. API integration and state management strategy
   d. Responsiveness, accessibility, and security considerations
   e. Any unresolved issues or areas requiring further clarification
4. Format the results in the following way:

<conversation_summary>
<decisions>
[List decisions made by the user, numbered].
</decisions>
<matched_recommendations>
[List of the most relevant recommendations matched to the conversation, numbered]
</matched_recommendations>
<ui_architecture_planning_summary>
[Provide a detailed conversation summary, including the elements listed in step 3].
</ui_architecture_planning_summary>
<unresolved_issues>
[List any unresolved issues or areas requiring further clarification, if any exist]
</unresolved_issues>
</conversation_summary>

The final output should contain only content in markdown format. Ensure your summary is clear, concise, and provides valuable information for the next stage of UI architecture planning and API integration.
