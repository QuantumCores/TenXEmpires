# Product Requirements Document (PRD) – TenX Empires MVP

## 1. Product Overview

TenX Empires is a browser-based, single-player, turn-based strategy prototype. The MVP delivers a simple but fully playable loop: authenticate, start a fixed 20×15 hex map, move and attack with basic units, **manage city economies manually**, contest cities, play against a deterministic AI in strict alternating turns, and save/load progress from the backend (3 manual slots plus 5 autosaves). The experience targets 1080p and emphasizes responsiveness, clarity, and deterministic outcomes without animations or audio.

### Goals

- Demonstrate an end-to-end, server-authoritative, single-player gameplay loop **with manual economy management**.
- Provide reliable save/load with manual slots and autosaves.
- Keep turns fast (AI ≤ 500 ms) and the JS bundle small (≤ 300 KB gzip).
- Capture essential analytics events to evaluate playthrough funnels and turn depth.

### Audience

- Strategy players evaluating a prototype without onboarding friction.
- Internal dev/product stakeholders measuring playthrough and performance.

### Scope Summary

- **Authentication:** ASP.NET Identity (email/password). No guest play; public About/Gallery only.
- **Frontend:** React 19 + TailwindCSS 4 (PostCSS) + Vite + TypeScript 5; CSS + SVG UI.
- **Backend:** .NET 8 MVC Web API; PostgreSQL persistence; server authoritative.
- **Board:** Fixed 20×15 hex grid, pointy-top, odd-r offset; full visibility.
- **Units:** Warrior (melee), Slinger (ranged); one unit per tile (1UPT); move or attack per turn.
- **Cities:** Harvest resources (Wheat, Wood, Stone, Iron); **manual production (units, buildings) and expansion; 1 action per turn.**
- **AI:** Asymmetric deterministic priority list (auto-produce/auto-behavior); completes turn < 500 ms.
- **Saves:** 3 manual slots + 5 autosaves (ring buffer on end-turn); retention 3 months.
- **Analytics:** Minimal event set with per-turn batching.
- **Testing:** Vitest/RTL (frontend), xUnit/Testcontainers (backend), Playwright (E2E), k6 (performance).
- **Deployment:** Github actions, Dockerized, CI/CD to DigitalOcean (sizing and ingress TBD).

### Constraints and Non-functional Targets

- JS bundle ≤ 300 KB (gzip). AI turn ≤ 500 ms. Session idle timeout 30 min.
- API rate limit 60 req/min. Strict CORS and anti-forgery. Analytics batched 1 call/turn.
- Assets owned; include Privacy and Cookie pages; ASSETS.md in repo.

### Assumptions

- Single AI opponent; fixed spawns; handcrafted map embedded as a resource.
- **AI uses simplified/automatic economy rules (asymmetric design) to ensure performance.**
- All in-reach city tiles are considered worked by default; no tile assignment UI in MVP.

### Outcomes

- A playable slice validating core mechanics, data model, and performance targets.
- Actionable analytics on funnels (start, turns taken, finish) and save behavior.

## 2. User Problem

Players need a quick, responsive way to try a new TBS concept in the browser without learning complex systems. The MVP should let them log in, start a match instantly on a fixed map, make clear tactical choices each turn, and see an AI respond quickly. Progress must be reliable across sessions via simple save/load. Product needs telemetry to understand engagement and completion.

### Pain Points Addressed

- **Slow or unclear turn resolution:** AI must be fast and deterministic.
- **Ambiguous movement/combat:** preview paths, deterministic combat, clear rules (1UPT).
- **Lost progress:** server-side saves with retention and slot management.
- **Complex onboarding:** fixed content, full visibility, simple two-unit roster.
- **Privacy and control:** delete account purges saves/metrics; data retention is limited.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Authentication and Access

- Email/password via ASP.NET Identity only; no third-party auth in MVP.
- No guest play; unauthenticated users may view About and Gallery.
- Session idle timeout of 30 minutes; enforced client- and server-side.
- Rate limit 60 requests/min per client identity.
- Delete account purges user profile and save slots; analytics events are retained in pseudonymous form (salted user_key).
- Minimal profile data; retention 3 months from last end-turn.

### 3.2 Game Loop and Turn System

- Strict order: player turn, then AI turn, repeat until win condition.
- End turn via UI button or keyboard key E.
- No undo; no move confirmations.
- End-turn summary toast lists pending actions.
- **Interaction Priority:** If a unit occupies a city tile, first click selects the unit; second click selects the city.

### 3.3 Map and Movement

- Map: fixed 20×15, pointy-top hexes, odd-r offset coordinates.
- Distance: offset→cube conversion; cube metric.
- Pathfinding: A* with uniform cost (1 per tile).
- Full map visibility (no fog of war).
- Selecting a unit shows path preview; second click executes move.
- 1UPT: cannot end on occupied tile; pass-through friendlies allowed.

### 3.4 Units and Combat

- Units: Warrior (melee), Slinger (ranged) with server-side stats.
- Actions: a unit may move or attack once per turn.
- Damage formula: DMG = Attack × (1 + (Attack − Defence)/Defence) × 0.5; round half up; min 1.
- Order: attacker hits first; if defender survives and is eligible, it counterattacks.
- Ranged units never receive counterattacks (adjacent or not).
- Ties go to the attacker.

### 3.5 Cities and Economy

- **City Stats:** HP=50, Defence=10; regenerate +4 HP/turn; +2 HP/turn under siege.
- **Resources:** Wheat, Wood, Stone, Iron. Stored per city.
- **Storage Cap:** 100 per resource type. Excess harvested resources are lost (overflow).
- **Harvest:** All resource tiles in reach are harvested automatically at end-turn.
- **Action Limit:** A city may perform **one** production action per turn: Spawn Unit OR Build Building OR Expand Territory.
- **Manual Spawning:** Player selects unit from City Modal.
    - Costs: Warrior (10 Iron), Slinger (10 Stone).
    - Spawns immediately on nearest free adjacent tile (North then clockwise).
    - Unit has 0 movement points for the remainder of the turn (summoning sickness).
- **Manual Expansion:** Player selects "Expand" from City Modal.
    - Enters "Expansion Mode".
    - Valid targets: Adjacent tiles not owned by enemy city and not occupied by enemy unit.
    - Cost: Wheat. Formula: `BaseCost + ((ControlledTilesCount - InitialTilesCount) * 10)`. BaseCost defined in `appSettings`.
- **Buildings:**
    - **Wooden Walls:** Cost 50 Wood. Adds +10 Defence to City. Instant construction.
- **Capture:** City HP ≤ 0 and a melee unit ends its turn on the city tile.
- **On final capture, remaining enemy units despawn.**
- **Siege:** Only non-occupied tiles contribute to harvesting under siege.
- **Reach Visualization:** Radius 2 (plus expansions); always displayed as SVG border overlay.

### 3.6 AI Behavior

- **Asymmetric Design:** AI retains deterministic auto-behavior and does not use the manual resource/action system to ensure performance and simplicity.
- **Priorities:** Defend city; attack if single-round win chance > 60%; explore; expand reach (fixed radius or simple auto-expand); produce units automatically when thresholds met.
- **City Defense:** Keep 1 unit on city tile if enemies within 3 tiles; maintain defender strength ≥ nearby enemy if possible.
- **Timing:** AI completes turn in ≤ 500 ms on reference hardware.

### 3.7 Save/Load and Persistence

- Server authoritative validation of all actions and state transitions.
- PostgreSQL storage; 3 manual save slots and 5 autosaves (ring buffer per end-turn).
- **Data Model:** City object includes `Resources` dictionary and `Buildings` list.
- Manual save to a chosen slot; delete/overwrite with confirmation.
- Manual load and autosave load restore exact state.
- Retention: saves kept for 3 months from last end-turn; analytics are retained (pseudonymous) and not subject to this purge.
- Map JSON is a versioned resource with server-side schema gate; incompatible loads blocked.

### 3.8 Analytics and Telemetry

- Events: game_start, turn_end, autosave, manual_save, manual_load, game_finish.
- Properties: user_id hash, game_id, turn_no (if applicable), timestamp.
- Batched to at most 1 network call per turn.
- Stored in DB; queries are manual in MVP.

### 3.9 UX and Display

- Target 1080p; hex width ~48–56 px.
- **City Modal:** Displays resource counts and production options.
- **Expansion Mode:** Highlights valid tiles; cursor change; Toast notification "Select tile to expand. ESC to cancel".
- **Wooden Walls:** Visualized as SVG overlay/ring on city.
- Pan/zoom: 75–150% wheel zoom; drag pan.
- No animations or sound; reuse SVG symbols; PNG assets ≤ 2× display resolution.
- End-turn summary toast surfaces pending actions.

### 3.10 Security, Privacy, Compliance

- Strict CORS; anti-forgery; role scoping for admin-only endpoints if any.
- API rate limit 60 req/min.
- Delete-account purges saves; analytics are retained in pseudonymous form (salted user_key). Privacy and Cookie pages state analytics retention and hashing approach.
- Privacy and cookie notices accessible.

### 3.11 Non-functional Requirements
