1. Keep them as is
2. Initial reasources are already set. 
3. Yes, apply the limit. One action per turn (Spawn OR Build OR Expand) 
4. Yes. The validation check should occur at the moment the user clicks the tile in "Expansion Mode." If the tile is empty at that specific moment, it is valid.
5. I'll provide PNG grahics of cities with walls. PRD is outdated on this matter.
6. Put both in appSettings.json: Economy:ExpansionBaseCost (default 20) and Economy:ExpansionCostStep (default 10). This allows easy tuning of the progression curve without recompiling.
7. Display a persistent Toast/Banner at the top of the screen ("Select a tile to expand. ESC to cancel") and change the mouse cursor to a distinct "Claim" icon when hovering over valid tiles.
8. Resources already have persistent icons on the map. Different types of icons are here `tenxempires.client\public\images\game`. We can use these icons in the city modal.
9. City state is already stored in the database. We can add buildings list to the city city model.
10. No more features.

Please preapre summary of the changes.

1 . Summarize the conversation history, focusing on all decisions related to PRD planning.
2. Match the model's recommendations to the answers provided in the conversation history. Identify which recommendations are relevant based on the discussion.
3. Prepare a detailed conversation summary that includes:
  a. The main functional requirements of the product
  b. Key user stories and usage flows
  c. Important success criteria and how they can be measured
  d. Any unresolved issues or areas that require further clarification
4. Format the results in the following structure:

<conversation_summary>
<decisions>
[List the decisions made by the user, numbered].
</decisions>

<matched_recommendations>
[List the most relevant recommendations matched to the conversation, numbered].
</matched_recommendations>

<prd_planning_summary>
[Provide a detailed summary of the conversation, including the elements listed in step 3].
</prd_planning_summary>

<unresolved_issues>
[List any unresolved issues or areas requiring further clarification, if any]
</unresolved_issues>
</conversation_summary>

The final output should include only the content in markdown format. Ensure that your summary is clear, concise, and provides valuable insights for the next stage of PRD creation.
