1. What should the “Start New Game” confirmation copy and UX be when an active game exists?
Recommendation: Use a single confirm modal: “Starting a new game will finish or delete your current game.” Require a checkbox “I understand” plus a primary “Start New Game” button; include a smaller link “Delete current game instead.” Persist “Don’t show again” per session.

2. Should “Forgot Password” and “Verify Email” be modals or standalone pages, and are they deep-linkable?
Recommendation: Use modals (`/login?modal=forgot` and `/login?modal=verify`) with focus trap; on completion, route to `/login?returnUrl=/game/current`; support direct deep links for emails.

3. Which user activities reset the idle timer (T‑60 s warning) and which do not?
Recommendation: Reset on keypress, pointer move/click, wheel, touch, and any successful authenticated API call; do not reset on background network retries or when the tab is hidden; visibility change to visible should reset.

4. How should predicted damage bars communicate lethal and tie outcomes without extra text?
Recommendation: Within the bars, highlight lethal segments and overlay a small skull icon on bars reaching 0 HP; for mutual lethal (tie), show skulls on both bars; no additional labels.

5. When nothing is selected, should the bottom center panel collapse entirely or show a placeholder?
Recommendation: Collapse entirely to maximize map space; reserve the area strictly for Unit/City details; avoid placeholders or tips in MVP.

6. How should the Saves modal structure content and defaults for quick use?
Recommendation: Use two tabs: Manual (default) with three fixed slots and inline rename/overwrite confirm; Autosaves showing the latest five with “Expires in ~N days”; sort newest first; include a “Load” and “Delete” (manual only).

7. What is the exact takeover flow for multi-tab control with `BroadcastChannel`/fallback?
Recommendation: The newest tab requests control; current controller shows a banner and yields on user click “Make other tab active” or after a 3 s lease expiry; background tabs enter read-only until they take control.

8. Should we surface hotkey hints in tooltips on key actions (e.g., End Turn E)?
Recommendation: Yes—append short hints in tooltips (e.g., “End Turn (E)”, “Saves (?)”); also list all in the Help modal; no key remapping in MVP.

9. What details should the “Report by Email” include from blocking error modals?
Recommendation: Open `mailto:` with a prefilled subject “[TenX Empires] Error <CODE>” and body containing JSON (code, message, requestId, gameId, turnNo, browser/version, timestamp); include “Copy details” to clipboard.

10. Given the PRD’s “no animations,” should camera panning be instantaneous?
Recommendation: Yes—use instantaneous panning by default; optionally allow a developer-only 80–120 ms ease for testing, disabled in production to adhere to the PRD.
