GPT remcomended adding migration project and testing scripts. Alos insisted on adding github actions that will run migration script.
I agreed since these are strictly related to our context and will be helpful later.

Installed posgreSQL from thsi site https://www.postgresql.org/download/
Following this instruction https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpqJzWCcQXY

Had to make minor changes to migration script
Added Identity schema migration script preceding the initial migration. This is beacuse initial migration requires identity tables to make FK constraint in one table
