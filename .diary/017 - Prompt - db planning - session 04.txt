0. Keep slot-based manual saves to match UX; enforce UNIQUE (user_id, game_id, slot) with CHECK (slot between 1 and 3) and reserve the ring buffer for autosaves only.

1. Prefer uuid (ideally time-ordered v7) for seamless EF/Npgsql support; 

2. Configure Identity to use a matching key type (e.g., string ULID or Guid), and ensure generation occurs in the app so DB FKs and cascades align cleanly.

3. Yesâ€”use bigint generated always as identity for games, saves, and analytics_events, cities, units (for warior, slinger stats), user_units (user and unit joint table with map position, health and moves) tables to avoid rollover risk; keep user_id as the ULID/uuid type consistently across references.

4. Use a session GUC (e.g., SET app.user_id = '...') and a SECURITY DEFINER function app.current_user_id(); define RLS USING (user_id = app.current_user_id()) and an admin role with BYPASSRLS.

5. application logic

6. Store a FK user_id for integrity and cascades; Also use it in views

7. Not required we will handle this application logic

8. Allow multiple active games for flexibility

9. For now we will skip indexes. We will have very low trafic in the beginning. We will think about this later
