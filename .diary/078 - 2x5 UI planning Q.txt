1. Finalize read timeout and retry policy (10 s only vs. 10 s + auto-retry once)?
Recommendation: Use Reads: 10 s with a single auto-retry (1 s backoff) and a visible Retry button; Actions: 10 s with inline spinner; keep messages minimal and consistent.

2. Should timestamps include timezone “Z” and milliseconds in ISO 8601?
Recommendation: Yes—emit/display `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` (UTC, no milliseconds) everywhere; show the same in tooltips and copied details.

3. Without keyboard shortcuts on Victory/Defeat, do we still provide full keyboard accessibility?
Recommendation: Yes—trap focus in the result overlay, set initial focus to “Start New Game”, and enable Tab/Shift+Tab navigation; no custom shortcuts.

4. What duration/easing should the “Next Unit” re-center animation use?
Recommendation: Use a single 120 ms ease-out translation to the unit’s center (the sole animation exception); all other panning remains instantaneous.

5. Do we offer an “Invert scroll zoom” preference for players used to opposite behavior?
Recommendation: Yes—add a toggle in Settings (default OFF) and persist per user/session; apply immediately to wheel/pinch handling.

6. What is the behavior on clicking an empty tile when a unit is selected?
Recommendation: Clear selection and overlays on empty tile click; keep selection when clicking UI chrome; ESC/right-click also clears.

7. Should attack commit on enemy left-click without any confirmation when legal?
Recommendation: Yes—second click on a valid enemy immediately executes the attack (no confirmations per PRD); on invalid, show a brief inline hint.

8. During AI turn (`turnInProgress=true`), do we allow camera pan/zoom?
Recommendation: Yes—allow pan/zoom and inspection; disable all actions and selection changes; keep the AI overlay non-blocking with input lock for actions only.

9. How should Idempotency-Key be generated and retained across retries?
Recommendation: Generate a UUID per user action, keep it in memory for 30 s (or until mutation resolves), and reuse only for the same retried request; never persist to storage.

10. Should the SPA add any client-side CSP/meta security headers or rely entirely on server headers?
Recommendation: Rely entirely on server-managed headers (CSP, Referrer-Policy, X-Frame-Options); the SPA should not inject client-side CSP/meta for MVP.
