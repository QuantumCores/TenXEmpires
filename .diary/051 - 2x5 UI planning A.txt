1. Use guarded routes with a PublicLayout (`/about`, `/gallery`, `/privacy`, `/cookies`, `/login`, `/register`) and an AppLayout for authenticated (`/hub`, `/game/:id`, `/account/delete`); unauthenticated access to gameplay routes redirects to `/login`.

2. Allow only one active game;

3. Yes—treat the server projection as source of truth; bootstrap with `/games/{id}/state`, lazy-load `/maps/{code}/tiles` and cache by `code` with ETag; re-render from returned `GameState` after every action.

4. I'm not sure. I thought in memory should be enough. But please present me options with pros and cons. Remember that I'm no a frontend developer and you have to guide a little bit in this matter.

5. Add explicit End Turn action (confirm endpoint path, e.g., POST `/games/{id}/actions/end-turn`), disable inputs when `turnInProgress=true`, show “AI thinking…” overlay (<500 ms), then refetch `/games/{id}/state`; surface `turnSummary` in an aria-live toast.

6. Provide a “Saves” modal in-game and a `/hub/saves` view both backed by GET `/games/{id}/saves`; support POST `/games/{id}/saves/manual` with overwrite confirmation, DELETE manual slot, and load via POST `/saves/{saveId}/load`; handle `SCHEMA_MISMATCH` with a clear blocking dialog. We prefer modals over views. We want to have Civ VI or HumanKind desktop game expirence where map is the main view.

7. Ties do not go to winner. On ties both units die if their health is < 0. Compute previews client-side using `/unit-definitions` for UX but always reconcile with server results; show path previews, first click to freeze path preview; second click to approve movement and move; invalid move/attack hints, and never apply optimistic damage.

8. Attach `X-XSRF-TOKEN` from the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie on all non-GET requests; intercept `401/419` to prompt re-auth (preserve intended route); show a non-blocking 429 rate-limit notice and backoff; never store auth in `localStorage`; enforce CORS-origin constraints.

9. Support keyboard end-turn (E), focus management (`:focus-visible`), aria-live toasts, and color-safe highlights; target 1080p but adapt down to ~900p via scalable SVG and 75–150% zoom; use Tailwind tokens for consistent spacing/typography without a heavy UI kit.

10. Centralize error mapping for codes (`ILLEGAL_MOVE`, `ONE_UNIT_PER_TILE`, `SCHEMA_MISMATCH`, etc.) to friendly messages; only retry idempotent GETs/reads with jitter; send a unique `Idempotency-Key` for actions/saves; cache lookups (`/unit-definitions`, tiles) with ETags; batch analytics via `/analytics/batch` once per turn.
