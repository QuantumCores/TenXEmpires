1. In MVP we stick with ASP.NET Identity (email/password) only

2. Target a single-screen fit at 1080p with ~48–56px hex width; add Ctrl/Cmd + mousewheel zoom (75–150%) and click-drag pan for smaller/larger displays.

3. Allow pass-through over friendly units but forbid ending on an occupied tile; this avoids soft-locks and reduces AI pathfinding edge cases.

4. Units don't heal in MVP. City +4 HP/turn. When under siege only +2HP/turn.

5. Keep MVP simple: ranged never receives counterattacks (adjacent or not).

6. Undo movement as well as movement confirmation is not available in MVP. When user selects a tile draw a path to that tile. When the same tile is clicked again move the unit. Show an end-turn summary toast listing pending unit actions.

7. We don't care about stalemates in MVP.

8. All assets are owned. 

9. Add a minimal Privacy page, cookie notice, and a Delete my account action that purges saves/metrics per retention policy; log these actions in metrics.

10. Define a versioned JSON schema. Add unit tests to verify schema compatibility with code. Include "schemaVersion" in files and implement a server-side schema gate to reject incompatible maps.
