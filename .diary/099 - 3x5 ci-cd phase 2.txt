Here’s a practical workflow for client changes:

## Recommended workflow

### During development
1. Make code changes
2. Run lint frequently (or use your editor’s ESLint integration)
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
3. Run tests if you changed test-related code
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Before committing
1. Run lint to catch issues
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
2. Run build to ensure TypeScript compiles
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Run tests to ensure nothing broke
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### CI/CD handles this automatically
- PR workflow: runs lint, build, and unit tests
- Main workflow: runs lint, build, unit tests, and E2E tests

## Optional: automate locally

### Option 1: Pre-commit hook (recommended)
Add a pre-commit hook to run lint and build before commits:

```bash
# Install husky (if not already installed)
npm install --save-dev husky

# Add pre-commit hook
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "cd tenxempires.client && npm run lint && npm run build"
```

### Option 2: Watch mode (during development)
For faster feedback during development, you can use watch mode:

```bash
# In one terminal - watch for changes and rebuild
npm run build -- --watch

# In another terminal - watch for lint errors
npm run lint -- --watch
```

### Option 3: VS Code tasks
You can create VS Code tasks to run these commands easily.

## Summary

- During development: rely on editor linting; run `npm run lint` when needed
- Before committing: run `npm run lint` and `npm run build`
- CI/CD: runs everything automatically, so you’ll catch issues there too

The most important thing is to run both lint and build before pushing to ensure your code is ready for CI/CD.
