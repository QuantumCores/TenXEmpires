0. Yes—update PRD and legal copy to document retention and pseudonymous hashing to align design and compliance.

1. Yes—freeze: auth.users (Identity), app.games, app.participants, app.maps, app.map_tiles, app.unit_definitions, app.units, app.cities, app.city_tiles, app.city_resources, app.saves, app.turns, app.analytics_events, app.settings.

2. Yes—use uuid (v7) for users; bigint generated always as identity for games, participants, units, cities, city_tiles, city_resources, saves, turns, analytics_events, settings.

3. Yes—implement exactly this RLS scheme and keep analytics tables outside RLS.

4. Yes—enforce only the agreed invariants in DB; keep all other rules in app logic.

5. Yes—include those headers and restore atomically as specified.

6. Yes—create app.turns with that uniqueness and keep payload minimal.

7. Yes—commit to idempotent upserts to keep environments consistent.

8. Yes—finalize this layout to keep analytics self-contained post-purge and dedupe retries when provided.

9. Not yet. First we have to preapre summary.

You are an AI assistant tasked with summarizing a conversation about database planning for an MVP and preparing a concise summary for the next stage of development. In the conversation history, you will find the following information:

1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. Technology stack information
3. Conversation history containing questions and answers
4. Model recommendations

Your tasks are:

1. Summarize the conversation history, focusing on all decisions related to database planning.
2. Match the model's recommendations to the responses provided in the conversation. Identify which recommendations are relevant based on the discussion.
3. Prepare a detailed summary of the conversation that includes:
   a. Key requirements for the database schema
   b. Main entities and their relationships
   c. Important security and scalability concerns
   d. Any unresolved issues or areas that require further clarification
4. Format the output as follows:

```markdown
<conversation_summary>
<decisions>
[List the decisions made by the user, numbered].
</decisions>

<matched_recommendations>
[List the most relevant recommendations matched to the conversation, numbered].
</matched_recommendations>

<database_planning_summary>
[Provide a detailed summary of the conversation, including the elements listed in step 3].
</database_planning_summary>

<unresolved_issues>
[List any unresolved issues or areas requiring further clarification, if any].
</unresolved_issues>
</conversation_summary>
```

The final output should consist only of content in markdown format. Make sure your summary is clear, concise, and provides valuable information for the next stage of database planning.
