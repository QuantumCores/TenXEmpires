You are an experienced software architect whose task is to create an implementation plan for the US-101 user story.

First, review the provided tech stack and feature documentation:

<tech_stack>
[tech-stack.md](.ai/tech-stack.md) 
</tech_stack>

<feature>
[F-001-manual-city-economy.md](.ai/features/F-001-manual-city-economy.md) 
</feature>

Now analyze the provided information and break down the `US-101: Resource Harvest and Cap` implementation details. Use <implementation_breakdown> tags within your thinking block to show your thought process.
Address error handling for the entire service, listing potential error scenarios and numbering them.

Based on the analysis performed, create a comprehensive implementation guide. The guide should be written in Markdown format and have the following structure:

1. Client side Step-by-step implementation plan
2. Server side Step-by-step implementation plan
3. Database changes (if needed)
4. Error handling
5. Security considerations
6. Backend unit test scenarios 
7. Frontend unit test scenarios 
8. e2e test scenarios

Ensure that the implementation plan:
1. Is tailored to the specified tech stack
2. Covers all sotry requirements
3. Covers error handling and security best practices
4. Contains clear instructions for implementing key methods and endpoints

Use appropriate Markdown formatting for better readability. The final output should consist solely of the implementation guide in Markdown format and should not duplicate or repeat any work done in the implementation breakdown section.

Save the implementation guide in .ai\features\F-001-US-101-implementaion-plan.md

 Client is in `tenxempires.client` folder. Important classes are in `tenxempires.client\src\components\game\MapCanvasStack.tsx` and `tenxempires.client\src\components\modals`. Server is in `TenXEmpires.Server` folder.
