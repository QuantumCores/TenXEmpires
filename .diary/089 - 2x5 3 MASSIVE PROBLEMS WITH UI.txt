There should be order fo implementation in the ui-plan.md
I added that order in the file naming and added one more task to prepare client for server comunication thte is 01 ui implementation plan


MASSIVE PROBLEMS WITH UI 

1. Set location
Set-Location D:\Source\TenXEmpires\tenxempires.client

2. Run the TypeScript compiler check from this directory.
npx tsc --noEmit


3. Run the linter to make sure there are no linting issues.
npm run lint

4. Start the dev server to verify everything runs smoothly:

5. Find process
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*node*"} | Select-Object ProcessName, Id, CPU

Fixed the problems with Sonet 4.5 because GPT Codex failed. 

Starting to implement login, register views

KLOPS: The backend doesn't have a forgot-password endpoint yet (only register, login, logout, keepalive, csrf, me)
